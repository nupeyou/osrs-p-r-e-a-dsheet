**Prepackaged excel instructions:**
TO FOLLOW: instructions on using the excel, for now I consider the python engine to be my real contribution, I'm quite happy with the excel I've made but it is FAR from perfect, consider it a demonstration. I would love suggestions on new analyses and for people to share their creations, the purpose of this is to aggregate helpful data in one place, excel gurus go nuts

the 4-hr average uses up to 4 hours of data, it restarts the database on each run so will not truly be a 4-hr average until it's been running for 4 hours however, the metric is still quite helpful after about ~30 minutes of data collection

**PYTHON INSTRUCTIONS:**
You do not need to do any coding, but you will need to install python. I personally use the anaconda distribution of python (here https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). After this is done you will need to install three different packages, do this by opening powershell and running pip install pandas, pip install requests and pip install xlwings
PLEASE SET A HELPFUL USER AGENT, all of this is made possible by the wiki's providing an incredible API, please be considerate of their request for you to provide them with a way of contacting you (https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/RuneScape:Real-time_Prices#Please_set_a_descriptive_User-Agent!)

**ALSO:** this tool is only to identify POTENTIAL opportunities, do your due diligence, check the weekly graphs, keep in mind that the end of a spike mathematically looks very similar to start of a crash when you're basing things on a four hour running average. There are links to the wiki price page everywhere in the excel, use them!


The excel file must be in the same folder as the python script, **the excel file must be named "OSRS GE.xlsx"**
